- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
In the cafe class, I made two overloaded versions of the sell coffee method. In one of them, the number of sugar packets and onces of cream is set to default of 1, incase the customer only specifies the size of the coffee. In the other, the ounces of cream is set to the default of 1, incase the customer only specifies the size and number of sugar packets. 
In the house class, I made two overloaded versions of the moveIn method. In one of them, the age of the resident can be added. With the other one, the age, and the income of the resident can be added. 
In the library class, I made two overloaded versions of the addTitle method. In one of them, user can input the author of the book, and in the other, user can add the author, as well as the publication date of the book. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Working on making changes to all classes simultaneously, rather than completely finishing one class at a time, worked.
